The revised plan will be a combination of long-term vision, goals, and practical strategies that will guide decisions about </span><span>land use, public facilities and services, economic </span><span>development, housing, related infrastructure and programs, and more. It will provide a roadmap for implementation, with clear priorities and actions.</span></p>
